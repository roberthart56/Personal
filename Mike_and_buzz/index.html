##Mike and Buzz

Victoria Shen suggested this idea in an analog version.  An amplified microphone sends output to a
speaker, which feeds back into the microphone.

This project is a first try at a digital version.

Mike has for a head a small circuitboard that uses the
Digikey part 423-1134-1-ND found in the fab inventory.  Board designed after Neil Gershenfeld's
"Hello world" example from the HTMAA course, found
[here](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/input_devices/mic/hello.SPU0414HR5H.png).
A 3.3 V regulator is included on the board so that it can be run from 5V on the Arduino board.  Quiescent output is ~1.5 V
with waveform +/- around that level.  Same could be accomplished with another amplified microphone module, like
[this one from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12642)
